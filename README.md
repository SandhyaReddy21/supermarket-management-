The Supermarket Management System is a text-based program that allows users to manage a supermarket's inventory.
Users can view all items in the inventory, add new items for sale, purchase items, search for specific items, and edit existing items. 
The program ensures that the user can only add items with valid inputs, and it keeps track of the quantity of each item in the inventory If an item is out of stock, the user will be notified. 
The program also allows users to search for items by name and edit existing items' details. 
Users can exit the program at any time.
